        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Arafath Ahmed. I am a student at Thomas A. Edison CTE HighSchool. I am a person who tries my best at everything I do. I make sure my grades are always above average and in general, try to be above average. I'm a very positive and friendly person if I get to know you and I will always be open to any crticism that is required.</p>

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>In the future, I desire to be something within the medical field. I want to be able to save lives and help people all around the world and put smiles on their faces. The most important thing to me is determination so being able to be a doctor will help me build up determination as I'm aware of all the struggles I need to go through. As technology advances, one thing that will always be a necessity is human life which is why I would love to be a doctor. I'm going to strive as much as I can in order to make that possible. </p>

        <h3>Coding and My Life</h3>        
        <p>Technology in general has impacted my life a lot. Everyday, using my phone, computer and even some game consoles is important to me as it gives me entertainment and allows me to have fun. Coding things such as websites gives me an insight on how much work it really takes to be able to enjoy these things. Having the ability to do all of these courses and getting an udnerstanding of it really does help me learn new things about technology and, as of now, I can see technology being a big part of the future. </p>
